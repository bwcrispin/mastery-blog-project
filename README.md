# mastery-blog-project

We've been hired to build a Proof of Concept (PoC) application for a company looking to make the next new hot blogging platform! This being a PoC app, we don't (yet) have to worry about all of the security and user management concerns that we would have in a fully functional application. All our client wants from us are the beginnings of the actual User Experience (UX). Our client also wants an in depth and COMPLETE look at our applications User Interface (UI), so let's make it look good.
